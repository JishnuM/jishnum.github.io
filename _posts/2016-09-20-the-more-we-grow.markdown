I wrote the essay below nearly 8(!) years ago. Weird how much I've foreshadowed my concerns near  graduation.

*Forgive the cookie-cutter phrasing and lazy plot - I didn't know any better and these were my cheap tricks in exam conditions to get decent grades.*

Pretty sure I wrote this 'ironically' (I don't think 14 year old me ever considered myself to be at risk of working too hard), but today the joke's rather lost on me.

Hope this doesn't prove too prophetic.
