What better way to start a new semester than with a lecture that promises you, that in this module, 'You Will Die'. (The answer is: no better way. Just to make sure we are on the same page).

The module's beginning was an event unto itself - with a number of alumni pursuing various paths sharing about their 3216 experience and unananimously emphasizing its benefits. One theme that came away from the lecture was the huge importance of hard work.

Prof Colin, quoting Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture (embedded below - if you haven't seen it, go watch it now) reminded us that 'the best shortcut is the long way, which is basically two words: work hard'. It was clear that hard work was expected - stories of last minute pivots and coding overnight in school were exceedingly common. However, I agreed with the alumni for whom the capacity of hard work seemed to be the biggest takeaway from the module - no matter what industry or career you choose to go to, the ability to push the little bit extra for something you really want will prove really invaluable.

At this stage, it's like being on a rollercoaster that's slowing move up. You know that the rush is coming, you are dreading it (yeah, I'm a coward on rollercoasters), but are also anticipating it at the same time, and you know that whatever happens, you're going to enjoy the ride.
