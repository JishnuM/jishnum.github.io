# Hello!

I'm **Jishnu**. I'm a software engineer and I enjoy reading and learning about new technologies, interesting theories from pop economics or psychology, and all sorts of fiction. I very occasionally write [here](https://jishnum.github.io/blog).

You can get in touch with me via [email](mailto:mohanjishnu@gmail.com).
