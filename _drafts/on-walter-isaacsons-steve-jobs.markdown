title: On Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs
---

So about 5 years late, I finally got through Walter Isaacson's *Steve Jobs*. It is an eminently readable and engaging work, and admirably handled the difficult task of portraying a seemingly balanced view of a man who polarises opinions quite strongly. I was never a huge fan of Apple or Jobs (for reasons I will get into later), so this work increased my appreciation of their contributions to technology. Another great personal benefit for me was gaining insight into Jobs' fanaticism about product. I had some vague idea that this was built on some mystical and faintly elitist idea of 'good taste', so reading about the varied aesthetic influences, from Zen shrines to Bauhaus, helped contextualise the development of Apple's sense of design.

I had two main issues with the book though. They might be unfair in that Isaacson set out to tell Jobs' story - not necessarily Apple's and definitely not Silicon Valley's. However, by focusing on Jobs and putting him up on a pedestal as a visionary whose sense of product redefined personal computers, music, and mobile phones, the book becomes guilty of ignoring or downplaying some real costs of the Jobs approach.

###### Open vs Closed

Isaacson definitely does bring this topic up multiple times - initially as a contrast between Wozniak, the hacker, who favors open systems, and Job, who prefers closed 'perfect' systems, and later as a contrast between first Microsoft and then Google, which built platforms, versus Apple, who offered a wholly integrated product.
