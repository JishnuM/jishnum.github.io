title: On Writing

Writing is hard. But not for the reasons you think.

##### The Background

Back in school, there were the English kids and the Science kids. (That's a gross oversimplification - there were the sports kids and the party kids and the music kids and the borders were amorphous - but for the purposes of this article let's stick with English and Science). Broadly, the English kids read fiction, wrote (bad) stories and poems, and competed in Debates and Quizzing, while the Maths kids read Hawking, built (and took apart) things, and competed in science competitions. I was an English kid through and through.

Why do I bring this up? Only to note that I did not start out predisposed against writing. I grew up loving writing and sharing what I wrote, and possessed (possess ?) a self-image of being a fairly decent writer. Despite this, I have struggled to commit to a regular writing schedule. This is an attempt to address that apparent dissonance - juxtaposing my current difficulties against the lack of them when I wrote essays in school.

In an act of amazing ingratitude, I lay the blame squarely on the wonderful technology that would allow me to write this and reach the whole world - the Internet.

##### On Topic
*What are you writing about?*

It is trivially obvious that this is the area where there is the biggest difference between writing in school or any other constrained environment versus writing autonomously on the Internet. Having the topic (and the format) handed to you is amazingly liberating as it gives you the opportunity to focus on the content. 

Without this liberating restriction, you are forced to make a whole lot of decisions before even getting to the writing. Importantly, these decisions become a key part of your argument - for instance, choosing to write about something makes it clear that you consider this topic worth your time writing and your reader's time reading.

Setting aside the sheer cognitive load, making these decisions is made much harder due to the nature of the information-dense world we live in. Pretty much every point seems to have been made somewhere on the Internet, likely with more authority, simplicity or creativity than you could have done. What topic can you choose which your personal opinion or insight would add value to any readers?

Talking about readers, we come to:

##### On Audience
*Who are you writing for?*

Back in school, this was a complete non-issue. The intended audience for class assignments was clearly the teacher. On a slightly more nuanced level, it was clear that any writing was for the 'average educated person', with the minimum assumptions made on pre-existing knowledge and beliefs. On the Internet, after being exposed to hyper personalised and targeted content, writing for the average person just doesn't seem good enough.

This is easier to illustrate with an example. Let's say I want to share some technical tricks I found to improve my web development workflow. What aspects of this would be interesting or helpful to a reader? What familiarity with the topic or the motivations can I assume? My instinct would be to assume exactly the amount of knowledge and motivations I had before I found / implemented these methods - which, on second thoughts, seems like a very bare-bones post, more suited to a forum like StackOverflow rather than a blog.

This concern is not limited to technical posts - any argument is made implicitly or explicitly *to* an audience, which requires an appreciation of the reader's current point of view. However, the old assumption of the 'average' person is made problematic, since an exposure to the rich diversity of views and opinion on the opinion makes it significantly harder to estimate a 'mainstream' opinion.

Further, writing for an average citizen on the Internet does not make much sense. The typical reader of a tech blog can be presumed to be far more aware of technological trends than an 'average' reader. Indeed, the average reader of *any* content on the Internet would probably have greater awareness of pop culture and technology than a random person on the street.

##### A Way Out

Clearly, despite these rather insurmountable problems, huge amounts of content is being written and consumed. How are these practical considerations being tackled?

Any hypothesis based on the bloggers I read would be fundamentally flawed, as the large majority of these writers have vocal and established bases of readers, whose level of expertise and interest is made clear. However, using this lens, it seems that there is no problem at all! After all, with no existing audience to cater to, I should not be worrying about audience and topic - I should simply write, and see whom (if anybody) my writing interests.

This seemingly pat solution is however, extremely unhelpful. It leaves the question *"write what??"*  unanswered.

So what is the way out? Let's see.
